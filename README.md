# Doorguru

1. Description
Our project is intended to help with opening office door. Instead of using key or ID card, one can simply open it having Beacon App installed (iPhone 6) (https://github.com/netguru-hackathon/doorguru-ios) and coming close to the door. It is also necessary to place iBeacon in the surrounding for localization purposes.
